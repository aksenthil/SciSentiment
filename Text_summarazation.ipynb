      "In order to show how fair values have been derived, \u0000inancial instruments are classi\u0000ied based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as summarised below: Level 1 \u0000inancial instruments - Those where the inputs used in the valuation as unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has access to at the measurement date.\n",
      "Level 3 \u0000inancial instruments - Those that include one or more unobservable inputs those are signiﬁcant to the measurement as whole.3.14 Impairment of \u0000inancial assets Overview of the ECL principles The Company records allowance for expected credit losses for debt \u0000inancial assets not held at FVTPL, in this section all referred to as '\u0000inancial instruments'.\n",
      "The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a \u0000inancial instrument's credit risk has increased signi\u0000icantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the \u0000inancial instrument.\n",
      "If a borrower has various facilities having diﬀerent past due status, then the highest days past due (DPD) is considered to be applicable for all the facilities of that borrower.Based on the above, the Company categorises its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:Stage 1:12-months ECLAll exposures where there has not been a signi\u0000icant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that has low credit risk at the reporting date and that are not credit impaired upon origination are classi\u0000ied under this stage.\n",
      "Stage 1 loan advances also include facilities where the credit risk has improved, and the loan has been reclassi\u0000ied from Stage 2.For these assets, 12-month ECL are recognized and interest revenue is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset.For Investments measured at FVOCI – “The investment is classi\u0000ied as a Stage 1 in case there is no change in the credit rating or a change of one notch downward in the credit rating.Stage 2: Lifetime ECL – not credit impairedAll exposures where there has been a signi\u0000icant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit impaired are classi\u0000ied under this stage.\n",
      "For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognized, but interest revenue is still calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset.For Investments measured at FVOCI – In case there is a downgrade in credit rating by two or more notches, the investment is taken as at Stage 2 and life time PD is applied.\n",
      "For exposures that have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL is recognised and interest revenue is calculated by applying the eﬀective interest rate to the amortised cost (net of provision) rather than the gross carrying amount.\n",
      "A \u0000inancial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash \u0000lows of the \u0000inancial asset have occurred.Evidence that a \u0000inancial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:a) Signi\u0000icant \u0000inancial dif\u0000iculty of the borrower or issuer;b) A breach of contract such as a default or past due event;c) The restructuring of a loan or advance by the company on terms that the company would not consider otherwise;d) It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other \u0000inancial reorganisation;e) The disappearance of an active market for a security because of \u0000inancial dif\u0000iculties.ECLs are recognised as impairment on \u0000inancial instruments in pro\u0000it and loss.\n",
      "In the case of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the measurement of ECLs is based on the three-stage 58ShriramHousingFinanceLimited|AnnualReport2018-19 approach as applied to \u0000inancial assets at amortised cost.\n",
      "Financial guarantee contractsThe Company's liability under \u0000inancial guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in the statement of pro\u0000it and loss, and the ECL provision.\n",
      "However, \u0000inancial assets that are written oﬀ could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the company's procedures for recovery of amounts due.3.16 Recognition and derecognition of \u0000inancial assets and liabilities Recognition: a) Loans and Advances are initially recognised when the funds are transferred to the customers' account.\n",
      "d) Other \u0000inancial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n",
      "The diﬀerence between the carrying value of the original \u0000inancial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in pro\u0000it or loss.3.17 Oﬀsetting Financial assets and \u0000inancial liabilities are generally reported on a gross basis except when, there is an unconditional legally enforceable right to oﬀset the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously in all of the following circumstances: i) The normal course of business ii) The event of default iii) The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counter parties.3.18 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the enterprise has a present obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an out\u0000low of resources embodying economic bene\u0000its will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n",
      "When the eﬀect of the time value of money is material, the company determines the level of provision by 59ShriramHousingFinanceLimited|AnnualReport2018-19 discounting the expected cash \u0000lows at a pre-tax rate re\u0000lecting the current rates speci\u0000ic to the liability.\n",
      "As at reporting date, the Company does not have any such provision where eﬀect of time value of money is material.\n",
